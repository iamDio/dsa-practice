# Sliding Window Pattern

Uses two pointers to determine the rannge/subset of elements within an array that satisfies a given condition. 
Dynamically adjust the size of the range as you traverse through the list 
One pointer marks the start of the window and the other marks the end 
Window expands by moving the end pointer or contracts by moving the start pointer to meet certain criteria
string array linked list 
combined with hash maps to keep track of elements within the window 
Sample problem using this pattern: 
* Longest substring without repeating characters
  *
